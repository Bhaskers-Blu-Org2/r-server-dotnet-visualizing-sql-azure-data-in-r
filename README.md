# Overview
This is a sample R ShinyApp application which shows how to query data from a SQL Azure database in the Microsoft Azure cloud and visualise that data, which contains geospacial coordinates, onto a World Map. 

# Usage Guide
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Create or open your Microsoft Azure account
3. Restore the sample database included in the solution to a SQL Azure instance on your Azure subscription
4. Update the connection settings in your copy of the solution with the details of the database server and database name you just restored
5. Run the solution locally, or publish to ShinyApp to have the solution visualise the geo-spacial data in the SQL Azure database to a world map, and dynamic charts
6. Customise as you see fit!
